# AI-Research
College assignment where we created our own "world" and played around with different implementations and restrictions for an AI agent to find solutions to simple, pick and drop-off scenarios, in a chess-like grid
By running  it through different scenarios and algorithms, we compiled all our data and findings on a research paper.
